    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on [the 6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. [The data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018 (we'll come back to this).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional â€” the main purpose is to practice applying the concepts we learned in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.\n",

    "`check_historical_occurrence()` â€” checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set; \n",
    "\n",
    "`multi_ticket_probability()` â€” calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816; \n",
    "\n",
    "`probability_less_6()` â€” calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible features for a second version of the app include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Creating a function similar to probability_less_6() which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers. "
